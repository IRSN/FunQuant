\usage{
proto_map_algo_multistart(
  gamma_list,
  outputs,
  method_IS = "unique",
  density_ratio = rep(1, dim(outputs)[length(dim(outputs))]),
  budget = 10^3,
  threshold = 0,
  distance_func = function(A1, A2) {
     return(sqrt(sum((A1 - A2)^2)))
 },

)
}
\arguments{
\item{gamma_list}{A list of sets of initial prototypes}

\item{outputs}{The output samples that need to be quantized. If method = "percell", a list of output samples must be provided, of length equal to the number of Voronoï cells.}

\item{method_IS}{The method of Importance Sampling : "unique" means there is a unique biased density involved, "percell" means there is one biased density (and then one biased sample) for each cell. Default is "unique".}

\item{density_ratio}{A vector indicating the weight fX/g of each output. Default is a vector of 1. If method = "percell", a list of density_ratio must be provided, of length equal to the number of Voronoï cells.}

\item{budget}{The maximum number of iterations of the algorithm. Default is 10^3.}

\item{threshold}{A real positive number. When the distance between the new centroids and the previous ones is lower than this value, then we stop the algorithm.}

\item{distance_func}{A function computing a distance between two elements in the output spaces.}

\item{print_progress}{A boolean indicating whether to print the iterations or not. Default is FALSE.}

\item{trace}{A boolean. If TRUE, tracing information on the progress of the algorithm is produced. Default is FALSE.}

\item{all_starts}{A boolean indicating whether the function should return the optimal prototypes obtained for each start.}

\item{bias}{A vector indicating the bias that came out when computing the importance sampling estimators of the membership probabilities. Each element of the vector is associated to a Voronoi cell. Default is 0 for all Voronoi cells.}

\item{index_sampling_error}{Required only if method_IS = "percell". Indicates which of the outputs samples must be used for the computation of the quantization error.}
}
\value{
A list containing :
- gamma : the list of optimal prototypes
- probas : a vector indicating the probability mass of the prototypes
- cell_numbers : a vector indicating the cell number associated to each output
- iterations : an integer indicating the number of iterations performed
- record : a list containing all the centroids computed through the iterations of the best start
