#' @title Computation of the IS coefficients of variation of the membership probability for different set of prototypes.
#'
#' @param outputs The output samples that need to be quantized. Useful only if cell_numbers == NULL.
#' @param gamma_list A list of gamma on which we want to evaluate the IS coefficient of variation of the membership probability. Each gamma is a set of prototypes
#' @param density_ratio density_ratio indicates the weight fX/g of each output
#' @param distance_func  A function computng a distance between two elements in the output spaces.
#' @param cells The Vorono√Ø cell numbers that we are investigating
#' @param nv The size of the sample for which we want to estimate the IS coefficient of variation of the membership probability
#' @param cell_numbers An optional list providing for each set of prototypes the voronoi cell number of every output.
#'
#' @return A list of IS coefficients of variation of the membership probability obtained for each set of prototypes.
